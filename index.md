# What is it?

YugiQuery is a Python script to query and display Yu-Gi-Oh! data extracted from the [yugipedia](http://yugipedia.com) database. It is entirely built on Jupyter notebooks and Git. The notebooks are rendered as HTML reports and can be displayed as an "always up to date" static web page by laveraging on GitHub pages. The raw data is kept as compressed CSV files (.bz2) with timestamps and changelogs for a thorough record of the game's history. Every operation is recorded on git with a descriptive commit message.
